			<h4  style="color:yellow;">I am Muhammad Aizat Bin Ahmad Fauzi who is currently in the final semester
 in the Information Management course.I am from Bagan Serai, Perak. I was born on January 21, 2001. I am one of the students who is currently studying at UITM Sungai Petani branch, Kedah.My hobby in my spare time is to do something quiet but fun like watching a movie.My favorite food is all my mom’s cooking because my mom’s cooking is all delicious.I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.My parents are outgoing people and they are quite down to earth. I get lots of attention from both of my parents, my grandparents, their friends and basically everyone around me. This probably explains why I crave attention wherever I go and I only associate with people who show me care and attention.
I love meeting people and I love making friends with people who are social. I am who I am, and I make no excuses for how I have turned out.
